 <div class="text">Subaru BRZ
  <p>Prioritizing affordability and lightweight agility over high horsepower and high-priced exclusivity, the 2022 Subaru BRZ continues to be a pure sports car for everyone. The completely redesigned rear-drive-only coupe remains a unique entry in Subaru's otherwise all-wheel-drive lineup. The same is in store for its mechanical twin, the Toyota 86. With a 228-hp naturally aspirated flat-four, the BRZ is more powerful than before, which at least partly addresses one of our biggest complaints. Combine that with a lower center of gravity as well as a feathery curb weight and this assertively styled 2+2 hatchback is set up to deliver the seat-of-your-pants feeling that defines all great sports cars. With a new interior design that brings modern tech but preserves its predecessor's practicality, the 2022 BRZ leapfrogs affordable sports-cars favorites like the Mazda MX-5 Miata and earns a 10Best nod and a spot on our Editors' Choice list.</p>
