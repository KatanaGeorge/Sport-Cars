<div class="text">Mazda MX-5 Miata
  <p>Few cars deliver driving thrills at an affordable price quite like the 2022 Mazda MX-5 Miata, and it's the only affordable sports car with a convertible top. It's also on our 2022 Editors' Choice list. A spunky four-cylinder primarily pairs with a satisfying six-speed manual, but an automatic transmission is offered, too. The Miata's handling is eager and playful, which makes encountering twisty roads a joyful experience. Most versions come with a manually-folding soft-top, but there's a more expensive RF model available with a power-folding Targa hardtop. With either roof, the Miata's interior is snug but nicely equipped, with infotainment features such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto standard across all trims.</p>
