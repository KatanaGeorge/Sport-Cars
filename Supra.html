It's been a few years since the Supra rejoined the Toyota lineup after a long hiatus, but despite our growing familiarity, the 2022 Supra remains one of our favorite sports cars. In fact, it's on our 2022 Editors' Choice list. Although it was developed and is built alongside the BMW Z4 convertible, the Supra coupe offers a personality that's unique from its Bavarian brother, even though the two cars share the same powertrains. The latter include two turbocharged engines, a standard 255-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder and an optional 382-hp 3.0-liter inline-six. Both feed the rear wheels via a snappy eight-speed automatic transmission. The Toyota's cabin is snug and surprisingly premium, largely because it pulls from the BMW parts bin. The 2022 Supra also packs plenty of infotainment features and safety tech, too.</p>
